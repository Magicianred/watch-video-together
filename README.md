# 👁 Watch Video Togather
One day you are bored and want to watch video with your friend from Youtube.WHY DO YOU WAITING !!
I built a project for this problem with React.js and Youtube Data API v3.
**Here is what you need and its open source !!!** 


# ⛓ How does work ? 

This project powered by Youtube Data API v3. In `'src/components/navbar/navbar.jsx'` you can see what i did for api [#25]. 

## ✍🏼 Client Side

My client side powered by `react-bootstrap`, for communication with API i used `axios`.So quite understandable i think.

## ⚙️ Server Side

🛠 Server side is still in work in process but i'll write it with `Node.js`, `Fastify` and `Socket.io` 🛠 

# How to install ?

```sh
npm install
```
> Then...
```sh
npm start
```
**Its done ! 🎉**

# 🔎 Is there a mistake or a line that you can make better quality? GO PR !!!
